 /**
  * \file logger.h
  * \brief QSMS logging functions.
  *
  * \details
  * This header defines the internal logging functions for the Quantum Secure Tunneling Protocol (QSMS).
  * These functions provide a basic logging subsystem to record operational events, errors, and diagnostic
  * messages during QSMS execution. The logging system is designed for debugging and monitoring purposes and
  * includes functionality to initialize the log, write messages, read and print the log, reset (clear) the log,
  * and retrieve the current log file size.
  *
  * The logging subsystem uses several defined constants:
  *
  * - \c QSMS_LOGGING_MESSAGE_MAX: Defines the maximum allowed length (in characters) for a single log message.
  * - \c QSMS_LOGGER_PATH: The default directory path where the QSMS log file is stored.
  * - \c QSMS_LOGGER_FILE: The default log filename.
  * - \c QSMS_LOGGER_HEAD: The header string written to the log file at initialization, which typically includes
  *   version information.
  *
  * The logger also includes a built-in manual test (\c qsms_logger_test()) that exercises all of the logging
  * functions to ensure proper operation.
  *
  * \note These functions and constants are internal and non-exportable.
