 * \brief The server connection collection.
 *
 * \details
 * This header file defines internal functions for managing the collection of connection state objects
 * used by the QSMP server. The connections collection maintains an array of connection states (of type
 * \c qsmp_connection_state), each representing an active or available socket connection. The functions
 * declared herein allow for:
 *
 * - Checking the active status of a connection slot.
 * - Adding new connection states to the collection.
 * - Retrieving connection states by instance or index.
 * - Initializing and disposing of the connections collection.
 * - Resetting and clearing connection states.
 * - Determining the capacity and availability of the collection.
 * - Running self-tests to ensure the collection operates correctly.
 *
 * \note These functions are internal and non-exportable.
